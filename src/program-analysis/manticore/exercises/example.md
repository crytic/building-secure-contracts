# Example: Arithmetic overflow

This scenario is given as an example. You can follow its structure to solve the exercises.

[`my_token.py`](example/my_token.py) uses Manticore to find for an attacker to generate tokens during a transfer on Token ([my_token.sol](example/my_token.sol)).

## Proposed scenario

We use the pattern initialization, exploration and property for our scripts.

## Initialization

- Create one user account
- Create the contract account

## Exploration

- Call balances on the user account
- Call transfer with symbolic destination and value
- Call balances on the user account

## Property

- Check if the user can have more token after the transfer than before.

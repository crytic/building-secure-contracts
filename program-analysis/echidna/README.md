# Echidna Tutorial

The aim of this tutorial is to show how to use Echidna to automatically test smart contracts.

The first part introduces how to write a property for Echidna.
The second part is a set of exercises to solve.

## Installation

Echidna can be installed through docker or using the pre-compiled binary.

### Echidna through docker

```bash
docker pull trailofbits/eth-security-toolbox
docker run -it -v "$PWD":/home/training trailofbits/eth-security-toolbox
```

*The last command runs eth-security-toolbox in a docker that has access to your current directory. You can change the files from your host, and run the tools on the files from the docker*

Inside docker, run :

```bash
solc-select 0.5.11
cd /home/training
```

### Binary

[https://github.com/crytic/echidna/releases/tag/v1.6.0](https://github.com/crytic/echidna/releases/tag/v1.6.0)

solc 0.5.11 is recommended for the exercises.

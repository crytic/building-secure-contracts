# Echidna Tutorial

The aim of this tutorial is to show how to use Echidna to automatically test smart contracts.

The first part introduces how to write properties for Echidna.
The second part is a set of exercises to solve.

## Installation

Echidna can be installed through docker or using the pre-compiled binary.

### Echidna through docker

```bash
docker pull trailofbits/eth-security-toolbox
docker run -it -v "$PWD":/home/training trailofbits/eth-security-toolbox
```

*The last command runs eth-security-toolbox in a docker container that has access to your current directory. You can change the files from your host and run the tools on the files through the container*

Inside docker, run :

```bash
solc-select 0.5.11
cd /home/training
```

### Binary

[https://github.com/crytic/echidna/releases/tag/v2.0.0](https://github.com/crytic/echidna/releases/tag/v2.0.0)

The solc version is important to ensure that these exercises work as expected, we tested them using version 0.5.11.

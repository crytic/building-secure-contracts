## Setup

1. Follow the instructions on the [Damn Vulnerable DeFi CTF][ctf] page, namely:
    - clone the repo via `git clone https://github.com/tinchoabbate/damn-vulnerable-defi -b v2.0.0`, and
    - install the dependencies via `yarn install`.
2. To run Echidna on these contracts you must comment out the `dependencyCompiler` section in `hardhat.config.js`. Otherwise, the project will not compile with [`crytic-compile`](https://github.com/crytic/crytic-compile). See the example provided [here](./exercises/exercise5/example.hardhat.config.ts).
3. Create a contract called `UnstoppableEchidna` in the `contracts/unstoppable` directory.
4. Analyze the `before` function in `test/unstoppable/unstoppable.challenge.js` to identify what initial setup needs to be done.
5. Please comment out the `_transfer` function in `contracts/the-rewarder/AccountingToken.sol`. This will aid in Echidna in solving the challenge a lot faster. You may uncomment the `_transfer` function upon completion of this exercise.

Hint: You don't need to make the setup very complex. It is possible to find the bug with just three contracts:
  - `DamnValuableToken`
  - `UnstoppableLender`
  - `ReceiverUnstoppable`

No skeleton will be provided for this exercise.

## Goals

- Setup the testing environment with the right contracts and necessary balances.
- Add a property to check whether `UnstoppableLender` can always provide flash loans.
- Create `config.yaml` with the necessary configuration option(s).
- Once Echidna finds the bug, fix the issue, and re-try your property with Echidna.

Hint: You might have to use the `multi-abi` configuration option in this exercise.
## Solution

This solution can be found in [exercises/exercise5/solution.sol](./exercises/exercise5/solution.sol)

<summary>Solution Explained (spoilers ahead)</summary>


Note: Please make sure that you have placed `solution.sol` (or `UnstoppableEchidna.sol`) in `contracts/unstoppable`. 

The goal of the unstoppable challenge is to realize that `UnstoppableLender` has two modes of tracking its balance: `poolBalance` and `damnValuableToken.balanceOf(address(this))`.

`poolBalance` is added to when someone calls `depositTokens()`.

However, a user can call `damnValuableToken.transfer()` directly and increase the `balanceOf(address(this))` without increasing `poolBalance`.

Now, the two balance trackers are out-of-sync.

When Echidna calls `pool.flashLoan(10)`, the assertion `assert(poolBalance == balanceBefore)` in `UnstoppableLender` will break and the pool can no longer provide flash loans.

See example output below from Echidna:

```bash
$ npx hardhat clean && npx hardhat compile --force && echidna-test . --contract UnstoppableEchidna --multi-abi --config contracts/unstoppable/config.yaml

...

echidna_testFlashLoan: failed!ðŸ’¥  
  Call sequence:
    transfer(0x62d69f6867a0a084c6d313943dc22023bc263691,1296000)

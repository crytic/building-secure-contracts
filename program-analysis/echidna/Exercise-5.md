## Setup

1. Follow the instructions on the [Damn Vulnerable DeFi CTF][ctf] page, name:
  - clone the repo, and
  - install the dependencies.
2. Create a contract called `UnstoppableEchidna` in the `contract/unstoppable` directory.
3. Write the initialization script into the constructor. This should be based on the `before` function in `test/unstoppable/unstoppable.challenge.js`.
- Hint: You don't need to make the setup very complex. It is possible to find the bug with just three contracts:
  - initialization contract and target contract of Echidna
  - DamnValuableToken
  - UnstoppableLender

## Exercise

4. Write possible entrypoints, callback functions, and/or properties. There should be a property that reflects the invariant we want to break (an address is not able to take a flashloan).
5. Write an Echidna config file.
6. Run Echidna ðŸŽ‰.
- Hint: Try using `multi-abi: true` in your config file.

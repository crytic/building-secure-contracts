## Setup

1. Follow the instructions on the [Damn Vulnerable DeFi CTF][ctf] page, namely:
    - clone the repo via `git clone https://github.com/tinchoabbate/damn-vulnerable-defi -b v2.0.0`, and
    - install the dependencies via `yarn install`.
2. To run Echidna on these contracts you must comment out the `dependencyCompiler` section in `hardhat.config.js`. Otherwise, the project will not compile with [`crytic-compile`](https://github.com/crytic/crytic-compile). See the example provided [here](./exercises/exercise7/example.hardhat.config.ts).
3. For this exercise we will be using Etheno to deploy the `SideEntranceLenderPool` contract. You can find more about Etheno [here](./end-to-end-testing.md).
4. Analyze the `before` function in `test/side-entrance/side-entrance.challenge.js` to identify what initial setup needs to be done.
5. Create a contract called `E2E` to be used for the end-to-end testing by Echidna.

No skeleton will be provided for this exercise.

## Goals

- Setup the testing environment with the right contracts and necessary balances.
- Add a property to check whether the balance of the `SideEntranceLenderPool` contract has changed.
- Create a `config.yaml` with the necessary configuration option(s).
- Once Echidna finds the bug, fix the issue, and re-try your property with Echidna.

Hint: It might help to start with doing a manual flashloan to get familiar with the workings of the target contract.

<summary>Solution Explained (spoilers ahead)</summary>

The goal of the side entrance challenge is to realize that you can use the `deposit` function to repay your flashloan. With the current implementation the lender pool has no way of knowing if those funds are from borrowed funds or "normal" funds.
  
We instruct Echidna to do a flashloan. Using the `setEnableWithdraw` and `setEnableDeposit` Echidna will search for function(s) to call inside the flashloan callback to try and break the `testPoolBalance` property.

Example deployment script using Hardhat:
```javascript
const hre = require("hardhat");
const ethers = hre.ethers;

async function main() {
  const ETHER_IN_POOL = ethers.utils.parseEther("1000");

  [deployer, attacker] = await ethers.getSigners();

  const SideEntranceLenderPoolFactory = await ethers.getContractFactory(
    "SideEntranceLenderPool",
    deployer
  );

  pool = await SideEntranceLenderPoolFactory.deploy();
  await pool.deployed();
  console.log(`pool address ${pool.address}`);

  await this.pool.deposit({ value: ETHER_IN_POOL });

}

main()
  .then(() => process.exit(0))
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
    process.exit(1);
  });
```
Make sure to add a localhost network to be able to deploy to Etheno. Example for Hardhat:
```javascript
  networks: {
    localhost: {
      url: "http://127.0.0.1:8545",
    },
  }
```

Now deploy to Etheno:
```shell
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

Don't forget to copy the initialization JSON file from Etheno to your fuzzing environment!
  
Example Echidna output:
```
$ echidna-test . --contract E2E --config config.yaml
...
testPoolBalance(): failed!ðŸ’¥
  Call sequence, shrinking (3003/5000):
    setEnableDeposit(true,208)
    flashLoan(1)
    withdraw()
    testPoolBalance()
...
```

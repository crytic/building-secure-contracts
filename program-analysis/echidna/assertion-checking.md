## Introduction

In this short tutorial, we will show you how to use Echidna to check assertions in smart contracts. For this example, make sure you use Solidity 0.7.x or older. If you run them with Solidity 0.8.x, the test will never fail.

## Write an assertion

Let's suppose we have a contract like this one: 

```solidity
contract Incrementor {
  uint private counter = 2**200;

  function inc(uint val) public returns (uint){
    uint tmp = counter;
    counter += val;
    // tmp <= counter
    return (counter - tmp);
  }
}
```

We want to make sure that `tmp` is less than or equal to `counter` after returning its difference. We could write an Echidna property, but we will need to store the `tmp` value somewhere. Instead, we could use an assertion like this one (*[example/assert.sol](./example/assert.sol)*):

```solidity
contract Incrementor {
  uint private counter = 2**200;

  function inc(uint val) public returns (uint){
    uint tmp = counter;
    counter += val;
    assert (tmp <= counter);
    return (counter - tmp);
  }
}
```

We could also use a special event called `AssertionFailed` with any number of parameters to let Echidna know about a failed assertion without using `assert`. This will works in any contract. For instance:

```solidity
contract Incrementor {
  event AssertionFailed(uint);
  uint private counter = 2**200;

  function inc(uint val) public returns (uint){
    uint tmp = counter;
    counter += val;
    if (tmp > counter)
      emit AssertionFailed(counter);
    return (counter - tmp);
  }
}
```

## Run Echidna

To enable the assertion failure testing in Echidna, you can use `--test-mode assertion` directly from the command line. 

Otherwise, you can create an [Echidna configuration file](https://github.com/crytic/echidna/wiki/Config), `config.yaml`, with `testMode` set for assertion checking:

```yaml
testMode: assertion
```

When we run this contract with Echidna, we obtain the expected results:

```
$ echidna-test assert.sol --test-mode assertion
Analyzing contract: assert.sol:Incrementor
assertion in inc: failed!ðŸ’¥  
  Call sequence, shrinking (2596/5000):
    inc(21711016731996786641919559689128982722488122124807605757398297001483711807488)
    inc(7237005577332262213973186563042994240829374041602535252466099000494570602496)
    inc(86844066927987146567678238756515930889952488499230423029593188005934847229952)

```

As you can see, Echidna reports an assertion failure in the `inc` function. Adding more than one assertion per function is possible, however, Echidna cannot tell which assertion failed.

## When and how to use assertions

Assertions can be used as alternatives to explicit properties if the conditions to check are directly related to the correct use of some operation `f`. Adding assertions after some code will enforce that the check happens immediately after it was executed: 

```solidity
function f(..) public {
    // some complex code
    ...
    assert (condition);
    ...
}

```

On the contrary, using an explicit Echidna property will randomly execute transactions and there is no easy way to enforce exactly when it will be checked. It is still possible to do this workaround:

```solidity
function echidna_assert_after_f() public returns (bool) {
    f(..); 
    return(condition);
}
```

However, there are some issues:

* It does not compile if `f` is declared as `internal` or `external`
* It is unclear which arguments should be used to call `f`
* The property will fail if `f` reverts, 

In general, we recommend following [John Regehr's advice](https://blog.regehr.org/archives/1091) on using assertions:

* Do not force any side effects during the assertion checking. For instance: `assert(ChangeStateAndReturn() == 1)`
* Do not assert obvious statements. For instance `assert(var >= 0)` where `var` is declared as `uint`.

Finally, please **do not use** `require` instead of `assert`, since Echidna will not be able to detect it (but the contract will revert anyway).

## Summary: Assertion Checking

The following summarizes the run of Echidna on our example:

```solidity
contract Incrementor {
  uint private counter = 2**200;

  function inc(uint val) public returns (uint){
    uint tmp = counter;
    counter += val;
    assert (tmp <= counter);
    return (counter - tmp);
  }
}
```

```bash
$ echidna-test assert.sol --test-mode assertion
Analyzing contract: assert.sol:Incrementor
assertion in inc: failed!ðŸ’¥  
  Call sequence, shrinking (2596/5000):
    inc(21711016731996786641919559689128982722488122124807605757398297001483711807488)
    inc(7237005577332262213973186563042994240829374041602535252466099000494570602496)
    inc(86844066927987146567678238756515930889952488499230423029593188005934847229952)

Seed: 1806480648350826486
```

Echidna found that the assertion in `inc` can fail if this function is called multiple times with large arguments.

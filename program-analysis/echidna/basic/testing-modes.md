# How to Select the Most Suitable Testing Mode

Echidna offers several ways to write properties, which often leaves developers and auditors wondering about the most appropriate testing mode to use. In this section, we will review how each mode works, as well as their advantages and disadvantages.

## Introduction

Echidna offer a variety of different testing modes. These can be selected using the `testingMode` config option or using the `--testing-mode` parameter. Each mode will be explained, highlighting the keyword needed for the configuration.

## Boolean Properties

By default, the `property` testing mode is used, which reports failures using special functions called properties:

- Testing functions should be named with a specific prefix (e.g. `echidna_`).
- Testing functions take no parameters and always return a boolean value.
- Any side effect will be reverted at the end of the execution of the property.
- Properties pass if they return true and fail if they return false or revert. Alternatively, properties that start with "echidna*revert*" will fail if they return any value (true or false) and pass if they revert. This pseudo-code summarizes how properties work:

```solidity
function echidna_property() public returns (bool) { // No arguments are required
  // The following statements can trigger a failure if they revert
  publicFunction(...);
  internalFunction(...);
  contract.function(...);

  // The following statement can trigger a failure depending on the returned value
  return ...;
} // side effects are *not* preserved

function echidna_revert_property() public returns (bool) { // No arguments are required
  // The following statements can *never* trigger a failure
  publicFunction(...);
  internalFunction(...);
  contract.function(...);

  // The following statement will *always* trigger a failure regardless of the value returned
  return ...;
} // side effects are *not* preserved
```

### Advantages:

- Properties can be easier to write and understand compared to other approaches for testing.
- No need to worry about side effects since these are reverted at the end of the property execution.

### Disadvantages:

- Since the properties take no parameters, any additional input should be added using a state variable.
- Any revert will be interpreted as a failure, which is not always expected.
- No coverage is collected during its execution so these properties should be used with simple code. For anything complex (e.g., with a non-trivial amount of branches), other types of tests should be used.

### Recommendations

This mode can be used when a property can be easily computed from the use of state variables (either internal or public), and there is no need to use extra parameters.

## Assertions

Using the `assertion` testing mode, Echidna will report an assert violation if:

- The execution reverts during a call to `assert`. Technically speaking, Echidna will detect an assertion failure if it executes an `assert` call that fails in the first call frame of the target contract (so this excludes most internal transactions).
- An `AssertionFailed` event (with any number of parameters) is emitted by any contract. This pseudo-code summarizes how assertions work:

```solidity
function checkInvariant(...) public { // Any number of arguments is supported
  // The following statements can trigger a failure using `assert`
  assert(...);
  publicFunction(...);
  internalFunction(...);

  // The following statement will always trigger a failure even if the execution ends with a revert
  emits AssertionFailed(...);

  // The following statement will *only* trigger a failure using `assert` if using solc 0.8.x or newer
  // To make sure it works in older versions, use the AssertionFailed(...) event
  anotherContract.function(...);

} // side effects are preserved
```

Functions checking assertions do not require any particular name and are executed like any other function; therefore, their side effects are retained if they do not revert.

### Advantages

- Easy to implement, especially if several parameters are required to compute the invariant.
- Coverage is collected during the execution of these tests, so it can help to discover new failures.
- If the code base already contains assertions for checking invariants, they can be reused.

### Disadvantages

- If the code to test is already using assertions for data validation, it will not work as expected. For example:

```solidity
function deposit(uint256 tokens) public {
  assert(tokens > 0); // should be strictly positive
  ...
}
```

Developers _should_ avoid doing that and use `require` instead, but if that is not possible because you are calling some contract that is outside your control, you can use the `AssertionFailure` event.

### Recommendation

You should use assertions if your invariant is more naturally expressed using arguments or can only be checked in the middle of a transaction. Another good use case of assertions is complex code that requires checking something as well as changing the state. In the following example, we test staking some ERC20, given that there are at least `MINSTAKE` tokens in the sender balance.

```solidity
function testStake(uint256 toStake) public {
    uint256 balance = balanceOf(msg.sender);
    toStake = toStake % (balance + 1);
    if (toStake < MINSTAKE) return; // Pre: minimal stake is required
    stake(msg.sender, toStake); // Action: token staking
    assert(staked(msg.sender) == toStake); // Post: staking amount is toStake
    assert(balanceOf(msg.sender) == balance - toStake); // Post: balance decreased
}
```

`testStake` checks some invariants on staking and also ensures that the contract's state is updated properly (e.g., allowing a user to stake at least `MINSTAKE`).

## Dapptest

Using the `dapptest` testing mode, Echidna will report violations using certain functions following how dapptool and foundry work:

- This mode uses any function name with one or more arguments, which will trigger a failure if they revert, except in one special case. Specifically, if the execution reverts with the special reason “FOUNDRY::ASSUME”, then the test will pass (this emulates how [the `assume` foundry cheat code works](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry/commit/7dcce93a38345f261d92297abf11fafd6a9e7a35#diff-47207bb2f6cf3c4ac054647e851a98a57286fb9bb37321200f91637262d3eabfR90-R96)). This pseudo-code summarizes how dapptests work:

```solidity
function checkDappTest(..) public { // One or more arguments are required
  // The following statements can trigger a failure if they revert
  publicFunction(..);
  internalFunction(..);
  anotherContract.function(..);

  // The following statement will never trigger a failure
  require(.., “FOUNDRY::ASSUME”);
}
```

- Functions implementing these tests do not require any particular name and are executed like any other function; therefore, their side effects are retained if they do not revert (typically, this mode is used only in stateless testing).
- The function should NOT be payable (but this can change in the future)

### Advantages:

- Easy to implement, particularly for stateless mode.
- Coverage is collected during the execution of these tests, so it can help to discover new failures.

### Disadvantages:

- Almost any revert will be interpreted as a failure, which is not always expected. To avoid this, you should use reverts with `FOUNDRY::ASSUME` or use try/catch.

### Recommendation

Use dapptest mode if you are testing stateless invariants and the code will never unexpectedly revert. Avoid using it for stateful testing, as it was not designed for that (although Echidna supports it).

## Other testing modes

Echidna allows other testing mode, which are less frecuently used:

- `overflow` mode: this mode is similar to `assertion` but it will only catch integer overflow (so no need to define any function with assertions). **It only works in solc 0.8.x or greater, for code outside `unchecked` blocks**.
- `optimization` mode: this mode allows to maximize the value returned by a function. It is explained in detail in [its own tutorial](../advanced/optimization_mode.md).
- `exploration` mode: this mode will not use any kind of invariants to check, allowing Echidna to collect coverage.

## Stateless vs. Stateful

Any of these testing modes can be used, in either stateful (by default) or stateless mode (using `--seqLen 1`). In stateful mode, Echidna will maintain the state between each function call and attempt to break the invariants. In stateless mode, Echidna will discard state changes during fuzzing. There are notable differences between these two modes.

- Stateful is more powerful and can allow breaking invariants that exist only if the contract reaches a specific state.
- Stateless tests benefit from simpler input generation and are generally easier to use than stateful tests.
- Stateless tests can hide issues since some of them depend on a sequence of operations that is not reachable in a single transaction.
- Stateless mode forces resetting the EVM after each transaction or test, which is usually slower than resetting the state once every certain amount of transactions (by default, every 100 transactions).

### Recommendations

For beginners, we recommend starting with Echidna in stateless mode and switching to stateful once you have a good understanding of the system's invariants.

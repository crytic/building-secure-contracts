# Using HEVM Cheats To Test Permit

## Introduction 

[EIP 2612](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612) introduces the function `permit(address owner, address spender, uint value, uint deadline, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s)` to the ERC20 abi. This function essentially takes in signature parameters generated through ECDSA combined with the [EIP 712](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712) standard for typed data hashing, and recovers the author of the signature through `ecrecover()`. It then sets `allowances[owner][spender]` to `value`.

## Uses 

This is a new way of allocating allowances, as signatures can be computed offchain and passed to a contract. This allows a relayer to pay the entire gas fee of the permit transaction in exchange for a fee and thus allows completely gasless transactions for a user. Furthermore this removes the typical `approve() -> transferFrom()` pattern that forces users to send two transactions instead of just one via this new method.

Do note that for the permit function to work, a valid signature is needed. This example will show how we can use [`hevm`'s `sign` cheatcode](https://github.com/dapphub/dapptools/blob/master/src/hevm/README.md#cheat-codes) to sign data with a private key. More generally, you can use this cheatcode to test anything that requires valid signatures.

## Example 

We use solmate’s implementation of the ERC20 standard that includes the permit function. Notice that there are also values for the `PERMIT_TYPEHASH` and a `mapping(address -> uint256) public nonces` , the former is a part of the EIP712 standard and the latter is used to prevent signature replay attacks. 

In our `TestDepositWithPermit` contract, we need to have the signature signed by an owner for validation. To do this, we can use `hevm`’s `sign` cheatcode, which takes in a message and a private key and creates a valid signature. For this example, we use the private key `0x02` and the following signed message, which essentially represents the permit signature following EIP 712:

```solidity
    keccak256(
        abi.encodePacked(
                "\x19\x01",
                asset.DOMAIN_SEPARATOR(),
                keccak256(
                    abi.encode(
                        keccak256(
                            "Permit(address owner,address spender,uint256 value,uint256 nonce,uint256 deadline)"
                        ),
                        owner,
                        spender,
                        assetAmount,
                        asset.nonces(owner),
                        block.timestamp
                    )
                )
            )
        );
```

The helper function `getSignature(address owner, address spender, uint256 assetAmount)` returns a valid signature generated via the `sign` cheatcode. Note that the sign cheatcode leaks the private key and thus it is best to use dummy keys when testing. Our keypair data was taken from [this site](https://privatekeys.pw/keys/ethereum/1). Now to test out the signature, we will mint a random amount to the `OWNER` address, the address corresponding to private key `0x02`, which was the signer of the permit signature. We then see if we can use that signature to transfer the owner’s tokens to ourselves. 

First we will call `permit()` on our Mock ERC20 token with the signature generated in `getSignature()`, and then call `transferFrom()`. If our permit request and transfer was successful, our balance of the mock ERC20 should be increased by the amount permitted and `OWNER`'s balance should decrease as well. For simplicity, we'll transfer all the minted tokens so that `OWNER`'s balance should be `0`, and our balance should be `amount`.

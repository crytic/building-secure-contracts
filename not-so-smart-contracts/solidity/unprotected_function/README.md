# Unprotected function

Missing (or incorrectly used) modifier on a function allows an attacker to use sensitive functionality in the contract.

## Attack Scenario

An [unprotected contract](Unprotected.sol) with a `changeOwner` function does not label it as `private` nor does it specify the `onlyOwner` modifier, therefore anyone can call `changeOwner` to take control of the contract.

## Mitigations

Review all sensitive or administrative function and ensure that they have appropriate visibility & function modifiers.

- BitGo Wallet v2 allows anyone to call tryInsertSequenceId. If you try close to MAXINT, no further transactions would be allowed. [Fix: make tryInsertSequenceId private.](https://github.com/BitGo/eth-multisig-v2/commit/8042188f08c879e06f097ae55c140e0aa7baaff8#diff-b498cc6fd64f83803c260abd8de0a8f5)
- Feb 2020: [Nexus Mutual's Oraclize callback was unprotectedâ€”allowing anyone to call it.](https://medium.com/nexus-mutual/responsible-vulnerability-disclosure-ece3fe3bcefa) Oraclize triggers a rebalance to occur via Uniswap.

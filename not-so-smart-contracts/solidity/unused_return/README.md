# Unused return

## Description

The return value of an external call is not checked.

## Exploit Scenario:

```solidity
contract MyConc{
    using SafeMath for uint;   
    function my_func(uint a, uint b) public{
        a.add(b);
    }
}
```

`MyConc` calls `add` of SafeMath, but does not store the result in `a`. As a result, the computation has no effect.

## Mitigations
- Ensure that all the return values of the function calls are used.
- Use [Slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither/) to detect function calls without any effect.

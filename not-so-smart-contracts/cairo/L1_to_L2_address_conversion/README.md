# L1 to L2 Address Conversion

In Starknet, addresses are of type `felt` while on L1 addresses are of type `uint160`. Thus, in order to pass around address types during cross layer messaging, the address variable is typically given as a `uint256`. However, this can create an issue where an address on L1 can map to the zero address (or an unexpected address) on L2. This is because the primitive type in Cairo is the `felt`, which is in between the range ` 0 < x < P`, where P is the prime order of the curve. Typically we have `P = 2^251 + 17 * 2^192 + 1`.

# Example

Suppose that the following code to initiate L2 deposits from L1. The first example has no checks on the `to` parameter and thus depending on the users' address, it is possible to transfer tokens to an unexpected address on L2. The second example, however, verifies to make sure this check cannot happen. Note that the code is just a simplification of how messages are sent on L1 and processed on L2. For a more thorough overview, see here: https://www.cairo-lang.org/docs/hello_starknet/l1l2.html.

```solidity 
uint256 public constant STARKNET_FIELD_PRIME; // the prime order P of the elliptic curve used 
IERC20 public constant token; //some token to deposit on L2
event Deposited(uint256 sender, uint256 amount);

function badDepositToL2(uint256 to,  uint256 amount) public returns (bool) {
    token.transferFrom(to, address(this),amount);
    emit Deposited(to,amount); // this message gets processed on L2
    return true;
}

function betterDepositToL2(uint256 to,  uint256 amount) public returns (bool) {
    require(to !=0 && to < STARKNET_FIELD_PRIME, "invalid address"); //verifies 0 < to < P 
    token.transferFrom(to, address(this),amount);
    emit Deposited(to,amount); // this message gets processed on L2
    return true;
}
```

# Mitigations

When sending a message from L1 to L2, remember to verify parameters, especially user supplied params. Remember that the type and range of Cairo's default `felt` type is less than the `uint256` type used by Solidity.

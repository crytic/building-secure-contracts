# (Not So) Smart Cosmos

This repository contains examples of common Cosmos applications vulnerabilities, including code from real applications. Use Not So Smart Cosmos to learn about Cosmos (Tendermint) vulnerabilities, as a reference when performing security reviews, and as a benchmark for security and analysis tools.

## Features

Each _Not So Smart Cosmos_ includes a standard set of information:

* Description of the vulnerability type
* Attack scenarios to exploit the vulnerability
* Recommendations to eliminate or mitigate the vulnerability
* Real-world contracts that exhibit the flaw
* References to third-party resources with more information

## Vulnerabilities

| Not So Smart Contract | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Incorrect signers](incorrect_getsigners) | Broken access controls due to incorrect signers validation |
| [Non-determinism](non_determinism) | Consensus failure because of non-determinism |
| [Not prioritized messages](messages_priority) | Risks arising from usage of not prioritized message types |
| [Slow ABCI methods](abci_fast) | Consensus failure because of slow ABCI methods |
| [ABCI methods panic](abci_panic) | Chain halt due to panics in ABCI methods |
| [Broken bookkeeping](broken_bookkeeping) | Exploit mismatch between different modules' views on balances |
| [Rounding errors](rounding_errors) | Bugs related to imprecision of finite precision arithmetic |
| [Unregistered message handler](unregistered_msg_handler) | Broken functionality because of unregistered msg handler |

# Not prioritized messages

Some message types may be more important than others and should have priority over them. That is, the more significant a message type is, the more quickly it should be included in a block, before other messages are.

Failing to prioritize message types allows attackers to front-run them, possibly gaining unfair advantage. Moreover, during high network congestion, the message may be simply not included in a block for a long period, causing the system to malfunction.

In the Cosmos's mempool, transactions are [ordered in first-in-first-out (FIFO) manner](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/blob/f9e0f77af333f4ab7bfa1c0c303f7db47cec0c9e/docs/architecture/adr-067-mempool-refactor.md#context) by default. Especially, there is no fee-based ordering.

## Example

An example application implements a lending platform. It uses a price oracle mechanism, where privileged entities can vote on new assets' prices. The mechanism is implemented as standard messages.

```go
service Msg {
  rpc Lend(MsgLend) returns (MsgLendResponse);

  rpc Borrow(MsgBorrow) returns (MsgBorrowResponse);

  rpc Liquidate(MsgLiquidate) returns (MsgLiquidateResponse);

  rpc OracleCommitPrice(MsgOracleCommitPrice) returns (MsgOracleCommitPriceResponse);

  rpc OracleRevealPrice(MsgOracleRevealPrice) returns (MsgOracleRevealPriceResponse);
}
```

Prices ought to be updated (committed and revealed) after every voting period. However, an attacker can spam the network with low-cost transactions to completely fill blocks, leaving no space for price updates. He can then profit from the fact that the system uses outdated, stale prices.

## Example 2

Lets consider a liquidity pool application that implements the following message types:

```go
service Msg {
  rpc CreatePool(MsgCreatePool) returns (MsgCreatePoolResponse);

  rpc Deposit(MsgDeposit) returns (MsgDepositResponse);

  rpc Withdraw(MsgWithdraw) returns (MsgWithdrawResponse);

  rpc Swap(MsgSwap) returns (MsgSwapResponse);

  rpc Pause(MsgPause) returns (MsgPauseResponse);

  rpc Resume(MsgResume) returns (MsgResumeResponse);
}
```

There is the `Pause` message, which allows privileged users to stop the pool.

Once a bug in pool's implementation is discovered, attackers and the pool's operators will compete for whose message is first executed (`Swap` vs `Pause`). Prioritizing `Pause` messages will help pool's operators to prevent exploitation, but in this case it won't stop the attackers completely. They can outrun the `Pause` message by order of magnitude - so the priority will not matter -  or even cooperate with a malicious validator node - who can order his mempool in an arbitrary way.


## Mitigations

- [Use `CheckTx`'s `priority` return value](https://github.com/tendermint/spec/blob/v0.7.1/spec/abci/abci.md#checktx-1) to prioritize messages. Please note that this feature has a transaction (not a message) granularity - users can send multiple messages in a single transaction, and it is the transaction that will have to be prioritized.
- Perform authorization for prioritized transactions as early as possible. That is, during the `CheckTx` phase. This will prevent attackers from filling whole blocks with invalid, but prioritized transactions. In other words, implement a mechanism that will prevent validators from accepting not-authorized, prioritized messages into a mempool.
- Alternatively, charge a high fee for prioritized transactions to disincentivize attackers.
